<!--
  String interpolation can be pull from the relevant component.ts
  In between the {{}} we can put in any expression. The only
  requirement is that it must be a string type at the end.
  You could call a function (also in the relevant component.ts) but
  you can't do a multi-line expression here (no ifs or control loops).
  You can put a ternary expression here too.

<p>{{ 'Server' }} with ID {{ serverId }} is {{ getServerStatus() }}</p>
